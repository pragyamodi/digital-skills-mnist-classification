# Practical Machine Learning with PyTorch - Webinar Guide

## Overview

This hands-on session introduces neural networks using PyTorch through a practical MNIST digit classification project. You'll learn to build, train, and evaluate neural networks while following a complete machine learning workflow.

**What we'll cover:**
- Neural network fundamentals (perceptrons, layers)
- PyTorch basics (tensors, modules, optimizers)
- Building models from simple linear classifiers to optimized networks
- Training and evaluation techniques

## During the Session

### Key Activities
1. **Understand the workflow** - Problem definition → Data prep → Model building → Evaluation
2. **Build two models** - Simple baseline and improved version
3. **Compare results** - See how changes affect accuracy
4. **Analyze errors** - Look at misclassified examples

### Take Notes On
- How PyTorch tensors work
- Model architecture decisions
- Training loop structure
- Evaluation metrics interpretation

## After the Session

### Immediate Practice 
- **Re-run the notebook** completely on your own
- **Experiment with hyperparameters**: learning rates, batch sizes, epochs
- **Try different optimizers**: Adam vs SGD
- **Add more layers** to the neural network

### Extended Learning 
- **Improve accuracy**: Add data augmentation, dropout, or better architectures
- **Try new datasets**: Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10
- **Build from scratch**: Create your own image classification project
- **Learn advanced concepts**: Convolutional neural networks, transfer learning

### Resources for Continued Learning
- **PyTorch Tutorials**: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
- **PyTorch Documentation**: https://pytorch.org/docs/
- **Goal**: Aim for >90% accuracy on MNIST through experimentation
